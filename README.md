## `attestation-exported-authenticators`

This is a WIP experimental implementation of [Remote Attestation with Exported Authenticators](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-fossati-tls-exported-attestation-02), which aims to demonstrate using the it with QUIC (for transport) and Intel TDX (as attestation platform).

There are currently still many parts missing.
