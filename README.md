This is a WIP experimental implementation of [Remote Attestation with Exported Authenticators](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-fossati-tls-exported-attestation-02), which aims to [demonstrate using the it with QUIC (for transport) and Intel TDX (as attestation platform)](https://github.com/ameba23/attestation-exported-authenticators/blob/main/tests/quic_tdx.rs).

There are currently still many parts missing.
